## Install

Inside a Claude Code instance:

**Step 1: Add the plugin**
```
/plugin add jarrodwatts/claude-delegator
```

**Step 2: Run setup**
```
/claude-delegator:setup
```

Done! Claude now routes complex tasks to GPT experts automatically.

> **Note**: Requires [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex). Setup guides you through installation.

## What is Claude Delegator?

Claude gains a team of GPT specialists via native MCP. Each expert has a distinct specialty and can advise OR implement.

| What You Get | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| **5 domain experts** | Right specialist for each problem type |
| **Dual mode** | Experts can analyze (read-only) or implement (write) |
| **Auto-routing** | Claude detects when to delegate based on your request |
| **Synthesized responses** | Claude interprets GPT output, never raw passthrough |

### The Experts

| Expert | What They Do | Example Triggers |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Architect** | System design, tradeoffs, complex debugging | "How should I structure this?" / "What are the tradeoffs?" |
| **Plan Reviewer** | Validate plans before you start | "Review this migration plan" / "Is this approach sound?" |
| **Scope Analyst** | Catch ambiguities early | "What am I missing?" / "Clarify the scope" |
| **Code Reviewer** | Find bugs, improve quality | "Review this PR" / "What's wrong with this?" |
| **Security Analyst** | Vulnerabilities, threat modeling | "Is this secure?" / "Harden this endpoint" |

### When Experts Help Most

- **Architecture decisions** — "Should I use Redis or in-memory caching?"
- **Stuck debugging** — After 2+ failed attempts, get a fresh perspective
- **Pre-implementation** — Validate your plan before writing code
- **Security concerns** — "Is this auth flow safe?"
- **Code quality** — Get a second opinion on your implementation

### When NOT to Use Experts

- Simple file operations (Claude handles these directly)
- First attempt at any fix (try yourself first)
- Trivial questions (no need to delegate)

## How It Works

```
You: "Is this authentication flow secure?"
                    ↓
Claude: [Detects security question → selects Security Analyst]
                    ↓
        ┌─────────────────────────────┐
        │  mcp__codex__codex          │
        │  → Security Analyst prompt  │
        │  → GPT analyzes your code   │
        └─────────────────────────────┘
                    ↓
Claude: "Based on the analysis, I found 3 issues..."
        [Synthesizes response, applies judgment]
```

**Key details:**
- Each expert has a specialized system prompt (in `prompts/`)
- Claude reads your request → picks the right expert → delegates via MCP
- Responses are synthesized, not passed through raw
- Experts can retry up to 3 times before escalating

## Configuration

### Operating Modes

Every expert supports two modes based on the task:

| Mode | Sandbox | Use When |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Advisory** | `read-only` | Analysis, recommendations, reviews |
| **Implementation** | `workspace-write` | Making changes, fixing issues |

Claude automatically selects the mode based on your request.

### Manual MCP Setup

If `/setup` doesn't work, manually add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codex": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "codex",
      "args": ["-m", "gpt-5.2-codex", "mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Customizing Expert Prompts

Expert prompts live in `prompts/`. Each follows the same structure:
- Role definition and context
- Advisory vs Implementation modes
- Response format guidelines
- When to invoke / when NOT to invoke

Edit these to customize expert behavior for your workflow.

## Requirements

- **Codex CLI**: `npm install -g @openai/codex`
- **Authentication**: Run `codex login` after installation

---

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/claude-delegator:setup` | Configure MCP server and install rules |
| `/claude-delegator:uninstall` | Remove MCP config and rules |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| MCP server not found | Restart Claude Code after setup |
| Codex not authenticated | Run `codex login` |
| Tool not appearing | Check `~/.claude/settings.json` has codex entry |
| Expert not triggered | Try explicit: "Ask GPT to review this architecture" |
